 == EOFFixtures framework ==
 This is a small framework that allows using YAML files to populate WebObjects/EOF based applications.
 
 I found this really useful for the following use cases:
  * Development
  * Initial users for newly deployed applications
  * Marketing/demo deployments
 
 A reference of the YAML markup language can be found here: http://www.yaml.org/.
 Inspired by the fixtures mechanism in the Play! framework (http://www.playframework.org/).
 
 == Usage ==
  * Add EOFFixtures to your WebObjects/WOnder application's build path (as a WebObjects framework in Eclipse).
  * Create a YAML file (default name is fixtures.yaml, you can change this via the EOFFixtures.fileName property) in your Resources folder.
    (For an example see the FixturesClient project.)
  * In your application's Properties, set "EOFFixtures.loadInitialData" to true or manually call Fixtures.load().
  * Pro-tip: Using different Properties.username files, you can define different fixtures for different environments.
  * To build this as a framework, you have to set ${scala.home} to your Scala install dir
 
 == Used libaries ==
 * Scala
 * Scalaj-collection (https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-collection)
 * Snake YAML (http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/)
 * Project WOnder
 
 
Enjoy!
